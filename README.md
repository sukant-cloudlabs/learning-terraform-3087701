# Learning Terraform
This is the repository for Learning Terraform. 

Terraform is a DevOps tool for declarative infrastructureâ€”infrastructure as code. It simplifies and accelerates the configuration of cloud-based environments. In this course, instructor Josh Samuelson shows how to use Terraform to configure infrastructure and manage resources with Amazon Web Services (AWS). After demonstrating how to set up AWS for Terraform, Josh covers how Terraform manages your infrastructure, as well as how to use core Terraform commands. He also delves into more advanced topics, including how to leverage code modules from the Terraform registry and how to create your own modules. Upon wrapping up this course, you'll have the knowledge you need to efficiently define and manage infrastructure with this powerful tool.
